This repository contains the source code for my Hello HTTP Server.

The purpose of this project was:

- to become familiar with back-end platform, Node.js
- to build a very simple web server that will only respond to a basic request
- to log each request to the console, on the server-side

Steps Taken:

1. Clone a set of files from GitHub.
2. Create a server object.
3. Add a listener to handle incoming requests.
4. Make the server log a message to know where it is listening and the port number.
5. Launch my project on a local web server via npm.
6. Conduct TDD (Test Driven Development) by writing code that passes HTML and JavaScript tests based on Mocha test framework.
7. Push my project into a GitHub repository.
